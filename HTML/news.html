                        in the capital.A flight ferrying the single-shot vaccine vials provided by United States
                        government to Nepal landed in the Tribhuvan International Airport Monday morning, as per the
                        Ministry of Health and Population. Authorities have moved the consignment to Teku based vaccine
                        storage facility managed by the Department of Health Services.As per preliminary reports,
                        individuals falling in the age group 50-55 will receive the jabs. However, the government is yet
                        to make an official announcement regarding the same.US government dispatched the said amount of
                        jabs to Nepal under COVAX facility, and in line with US President Joe Biden's pledge to donate a
                        batch of 80 million US-made vaccines globally to counter vaccine disparity.
                        Nepal so far has received and conducted the inoculation drive with COVISHIELD, developed by
                        Oxford AstraZeneca and manufactured by Serum Institute of India and Vero Cell developed by
                        Sinopharma and Beijing Institute of Biological Products.This will be the third of the Covid-19
                        vaccine to be used in Nepal and the first of the single-shot kind.The country that is
                        hard-pressed to control the spread of the contagion under the second wave of coronavirus
                        infection has the only option of vaccinating as many as its citizens if it were to put up any
                        kind of fight against a possible third wave of the pandemic.

                    <p class="cMar">Scientists using computer modelling to study SARS-CoV-2, the virus that caused the
                        COVID-19
                        pandemic,
                        have discovered the virus is most ideally adapted to infect human cells - rather than bat or
                        pangolin
                        cells, again raising questions of its origin.
                        In a paper published in the Nature journal Scientific Reports, Australian scientists describe
                        how
                        they
                        used high-performance computer modelling of the form of the SARS-CoV-2 virus at the beginning of
                        the
                        pandemic to predict its ability to infect humans and a range of 12 domestic and exotic animals.
                        Their work aimed to help identify any intermediate animal vector that may have played a role in
                        transmitting a bat virus to humans, and to understand any risk posed by the susceptibilities of
                        companion animals such as cats and dogs, and commercial animals like cows, sheep, pigs and
                        horses.</p>
